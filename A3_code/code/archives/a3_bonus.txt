Perform dimension reduction using PCA()

/* accuracy with different dimension */
dim: 10 	 M: 8 	 maxIter: 20 	 Accuracy: 1.0
dim: 8 	 M: 8 	 maxIter: 20 	 Accuracy: 1.0
dim: 6 	 M: 8 	 maxIter: 20 	 Accuracy: 1.0
dim: 4 	 M: 8 	 maxIter: 20 	 Accuracy: 0.96875
dim: 3 	 M: 8 	 maxIter: 20 	 Accuracy: 0.9375
dim: 2 	 M: 8 	 maxIter: 20 	 Accuracy: 0.75

The accuracy is pretty high for the dimension from 2 - 10. The accuracy is 100% for dimension 10, 8 and 6. And the accuracy decreases as the number of reduced dimension decreases.
